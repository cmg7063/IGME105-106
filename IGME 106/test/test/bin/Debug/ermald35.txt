Hi,

I don't usually message people first but your profile cut my attention :) I saw that you studied at RIT. I currently go there! It's a nice school. How did you like it? I imagine the brick fortress/wind tunnel has changed a bit since you've last been there. A lot of alum are surprised that Riverknoll is still here. 

It's funny that I came across your profile because you mentioned how you design furniture for a living and I'm currently taking a 3D class where I'm meant to be designing chairs, chess sets, houses, and etc. I'm horrible at learning learning perspective. You never really appreciate a thing until you've had to create a 3D model of it in Maya.

Hopefully you'll get back to me if you're interested... Or to tell me that you're not :)
